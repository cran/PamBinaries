#' @title Read Pamguard Binary Data
#' 
#' @description A wrapper for reading various types of binary data.
#'   
#' @param fid The binary file being read
#' @param what The type of data to read. Int64 is not handled natively
#'   by R, see note.
#' @param n The number of objects to read.
#' @param seek Whether or not to just seek instead of reading
#' 
#' @return Data of the type and number specified.
#' 
#' @author Taiki Sakai \email{taiki.sakai@@noaa.gov}
#' 
#' @note R does not natively support 64-bit integers. Current implementation
#'   is to read an int64 as 8 separate 1-byte raw pieces. These are converted
#'   from hexidecimal, shifted by the appropriate power of 2, then summed.
#'   Currently cannot read more than one int64 at a time, shouldn't be necessary.
